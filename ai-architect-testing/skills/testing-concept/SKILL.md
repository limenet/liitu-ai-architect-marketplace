  Creates a project-level TESTING.md that documents the testing concept
  from the project's perspective: which test levels are used (manual,
  E2E/Playwright, unit/Vitest), why each is needed, and project-specific
  details (commands, focus areas, device matrix, backend integration).
  Use when the user asks to "create a testing concept", "write a TESTING.md",
  "document our testing strategy", "create a test overview", "set up testing
  documentation", or mentions needing a project-level overview of all test levels.

# Testing Concept Document

Create a `TESTING.md` at the project root that describes the project's testing concept: which test levels are used, why they are needed in this specific project context, and the project-specific details for each level (commands, focus areas, device matrix).

This document is a **project concept document**, not a how-to guide. It captures the team's decisions about testing strategy. Individual test-writing guidance lives in the plugin skills (`/playwright-test`, `/vitest`, `/manual-test`).

## Output

Write to `TESTING.md` in the project root.

## DO NOT

- Include generic test-writing instructions (how to use `getByRole`, how to structure `describe` blocks, etc.) — those belong in the plugin skills
- Leave placeholder text unfilled — every `{...}` must be replaced with real project context
- Write in a language that doesn't match the team's working language

## What to Include

### Header

A two-line callout referencing the plugin and its skills, so readers know where to find test-creation guidance:

```md
> Testartefakte werden mit dem Plugin `ai-architect-testing` erstellt.
> Skills: `/manual-test` · `/playwright-test` · `/vitest`
```

### Per test level: Was / Warum / Wie

For each of the three test levels (manual, E2E, unit), write three subsections:

- **Was**: One-sentence definition of what this test level covers in this project
- **Warum**: Why this level is needed given the project's specific constraints (mobile app, SAP backend, complex business logic, etc.) — not generic rationale
- **Wie** (project-specific only):
  - Manual: which devices, which user journeys, release process, issue tracking
  - E2E: framework config location, test directory, how the app is started (dev server / mock server + command + port), target browsers and mobile devices, focus areas, run command, skill reference
  - Unit: framework, file location convention, focus areas (domain classes, mappers, components, architecture checks), run command, skill reference

### Summary Table

| Level  | Tool       | Speed  | Coverage                     |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Manual | –          | Slow   | UX, native behavior, devices |
| E2E    | Playwright | Medium | Full user journeys, browsers |
| Unit   | Vitest     | Fast   | Logic, mappers, components   |

## Workflow

1. Identify tech stack and backend integration from the codebase
2. Find test commands in `package.json`
3. Check `playwright.config.ts` for browser/device configuration and test server setup
4. Identify key domain classes, mappers, and architecture layers from the source tree
5. Ask the user for manual testing scope. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for the parts that have discrete choices — header "Devices" (multiSelect: true; offer the relevant platforms/devices, e.g. iOS, Android, Desktop browsers) and header "Cadence" (release/test frequency, e.g. per sprint, per release, before each deploy). Ask for the key user journeys as a free-form follow-up, since those are open-ended.
6. Fill in all project-specific details — write in the team's language
7. Write to `TESTING.md`

## Template

Use [templates/testing-concept.md](templates/testing-concept.md) as the starting point.
