# AI Architect Marketplace

A collection of plugins that bring AI-powered requirements engineering and system modeling directly into
[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com).

## What is AI Architect?

AI Architect is a methodology plugin that keeps requirements at the center of your development process. It provides a
structured workflow from vision to specification, ensuring consistency and traceability throughout your project — from
requirements catalogs and entity models to use case diagrams and detailed specifications.

## Architecture

The marketplace contains three plugins:

- **ai-architect-core** — Requirements engineering and system modeling (requirements, entity model, use cases).
  Works with any tech stack.
- **ai-architect-testing** — Testing toolkit for React projects (project-level testing concept, Playwright E2E
  tests, Vitest unit tests including architecture/layer-boundary checks, manual test plans).
- **ai-architect-dev-tools** — Developer workflow tools (conventional commits, project implementation guidelines,
  use case implementation plans).

Skills follow a sequential software development workflow:

|                            | Inception          | Elaboration                                  | Construction                             | Verification                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ai-architect-core**      | `/ai-requirements` | `/ai-entity-model`<br>`/ai-use-case-diagram` | `/ai-use-case-spec`                      |                                                            |
| **ai-architect-testing**   |                    | `/ai-testing-concept`                        |                                          | `/ai-playwright-test`<br>`/ai-vitest`<br>`/ai-manual-test` |
| **ai-architect-dev-tools** | `/ai-commit`       | `/ai-guidelines`<br>`/ai-commit`             | `/ai-implement-use-case`<br>`/ai-commit` | `/ai-commit`                                               |

## Installation

Using a marketplace is a two-step process: first add the marketplace catalog, then install the plugins you want.

### Step 1: Add the marketplace

From within Claude Code, run:

```shell
 /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/liitu-ch/liitu-ai-architect-core
```

This registers the catalog with Claude Code so you can browse what's available. No plugins are installed yet.

### Step 2: Install plugins

```shell
/plugin install ai-architect-core@liitu-ai-architect-marketplace
/plugin install ai-architect-testing@liitu-ai-architect-marketplace
/plugin install ai-architect-dev-tools@liitu-ai-architect-marketplace
```

After installing, run `/reload-plugins` to activate the plugins.

### Choose an installation scope

When installing via the interactive UI (`/plugin` > **Discover** tab), you can choose a scope:

- **User scope** (default): install for yourself across all projects
- **Project scope**: install for all collaborators on this repository (adds to `.claude/settings.json`)
- **Local scope**: install for yourself in this repository only

### Configure for your team

Team admins can set up automatic marketplace installation by adding this to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "liitu-ai-architect-marketplace": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "liitu-ai-architect/liitu-ai-architect-marketplace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When team members trust the repository folder, Claude Code prompts them to install these marketplaces and plugins.

## Using Skills

Skills are the core building blocks of this plugin. They follow the
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard and are defined as `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter and
markdown instructions.

### How skills work

Each skill has a **description** that tells Claude when to use it. Skills can be invoked in three ways:

- **Short slash command** — type the `/ai-*` alias (e.g., `/ai-requirements`) shipped by the plugin's
  `commands/` directory. This is the recommended way to invoke a skill explicitly.
- **Namespaced skill path** — type the fully qualified skill (e.g., `/ai-architect-core:requirements`).
- **Automatically** — Claude recognizes when a skill is relevant to your conversation and loads it on its own.

When Claude loads a skill, the skill's instructions guide how Claude approaches the task. Skill descriptions are always
in context so Claude knows what's available, but the full skill content only loads when invoked.

### Passing arguments

You can pass arguments when invoking a skill via either form. For example:

```shell
/ai-hello Alex
/ai-architect-core:hello Alex
```

Arguments are available to the skill via the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder and get inserted into the skill's instructions.

### Skill structure

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file and optional supporting files:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── REFERENCE.md       # Reference material (optional)
├── templates/         # Templates for output (optional)
│   └── template.md
└── examples/          # Example outputs (optional)
    └── sample.md
```

The `SKILL.md` contains YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) and markdown instructions:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---
Step-by-step instructions for Claude to follow...
```

### Key frontmatter fields

| Field                      | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                     | Display name for the skill. Defaults to directory name.                                     |
| `description`              | What the skill does and when to use it. Claude uses this to decide when to apply the skill. |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Set to `true` to prevent Claude from loading this skill automatically (manual invoke only). |
| `user-invocable`           | Set to `false` to hide from the `/` menu (Claude-only background knowledge).                |
| `allowed-tools`            | Tools Claude can use without asking permission when this skill is active.                   |
| `context`                  | Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context.                                          |
| `agent`                    | Which subagent type to use when `context: fork` is set.                                     |

## Key Concepts

### Marketplace

A **marketplace** is a curated repository that hosts and distributes multiple Claude Code plugins. It acts as a central
hub where plugins can be discovered, installed, and managed. When you add a marketplace to Claude Code, you gain access
to all the plugins it contains. Marketplaces make it easy to share and distribute collections of related plugins.

### Plugin

A **plugin** is a self-contained extension that adds new capabilities to Claude Code. Each plugin can include:

- **Skills** - Behaviors that Claude can invoke autonomously or that users invoke as slash commands
- **Agents** - Specialized subagents for complex tasks
- **Hooks** - Event handlers that respond to Claude Code events
- **MCP Servers** - External tools and documentation sources

Plugins encapsulate everything needed to work with a particular tech stack or methodology. When enabled, a plugin's
components become available in your Claude Code session.

### Skill

A **skill** is a specialized behavior defined in a `SKILL.md` file. Skills can be invoked explicitly as slash
commands (e.g., `/ai-architect-core:requirements`) or triggered automatically by Claude when it recognizes a matching
task. Each skill can include supporting files like templates and reference documents. Skills are namespaced by their
plugin to prevent conflicts between plugins. Claude Code skills follow the
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard.

### MCP Server

An **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server** is an external service that provides Claude with access to specialized tools,
documentation, and capabilities. MCP servers extend what Claude can do by connecting it to external resources like
documentation databases, APIs, and other integrations. They start automatically when the plugin is enabled.

## Security

Plugins and marketplaces are highly trusted components that can execute arbitrary code on your machine with your user
privileges. Only install plugins and add marketplaces from sources you trust.

## Troubleshooting

- **`/plugin` command not recognized**: Plugins require Claude Code version 1.0.33 or later. Run `claude --version`
  to check, and update if needed.
- **Marketplace not loading**: Verify the URL is accessible and that `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` exists at the
  root.
- **Skill not triggering**: Check the description includes keywords users would naturally say. Try invoking directly
  with `/ai-architect-core:skill-name`. Verify the skill appears when you ask "What skills are available?"
- **Skill triggers too often**: The skill description may be too broad. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` to the
  frontmatter if you only want manual invocation.
- **Plugin skills not appearing**: Clear the cache with `rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache`, restart Claude Code, and
  reinstall the plugin.
- For more troubleshooting, see the
  [official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#troubleshooting).
